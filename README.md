# Shadowplayer

Shadowplayer is a personal project application I designed to solve the problem of not being able to easily manage and preview recorded videos from NVIDIA Shadowplay. It provides a convenient way to select, preview, rename, and copy recorded clips to another folder for editing or later viewing.

## Features

- **Folder Selection**: Run the script and select a folder to index, typically your Shadowplay recordings folder.
- **Thumbnail Preview**: View thumbnails of all videos in the selected folder, allowing you to easily identify and choose the clips you want to work with.
- **Clip Selection**: Select one or more videos for renaming and copying to another folder.
- **Rename and Copy**: Rename the selected clips and specify a destination folder for copying them.
- **Destination Folder**: Use the browse button to locate and set a destination folder for your selected clips.

## Getting Started

To use Shadowplayer:

1. **Run the Script**: Execute the Shadowplayer script.
2. **Folder Selection**: A dialogue box will appear, allowing you to select the folder you want to index. Choose your Shadowplay recordings folder.
3. **Preview Videos**: After selecting the folder, the program will open with thumbnails of all the videos in that folder.
4. **Select Clips**: Browse through the thumbnails and choose the clips you want to work with. You can select one or more clips.
5. **Rename and Copy**: Rename the selected clips as desired. Before copying them, make sure to hit the browse button and locate a destination folder where you want to save the clips for editing or later viewing.
6. **Copy Operation**: Initiate the copy operation, and the selected clips will be copied to the specified destination folder.

That's it! With Shadowplayer, you can conveniently manage your Shadowplay recordings by previewing, renaming, and copying them to a separate folder for your editing or viewing needs.
